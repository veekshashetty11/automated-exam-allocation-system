# Automated Exam Allocation System

## Overview
This project is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) based system designed
to allocate students to exam seats and invigilators to examination halls
while handling multiple constraints.

## Why This Project Is Unique
The system handles multi-dimensional scheduling with:
- Student conflict avoidance
- Question paper set separation
- Load-balanced invigilator allocation
- Support for dynamic changes

## Features
- Multiple subjects and question sets
- Conflict-aware seat allocation
- Fair invigilator workload distribution
- Dynamic reassignment support

## Data Structures Used
- Arrays and 2D Matrices
- Graphs (Adjacency List)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Priority Queue (Min Heap)

## Language
C++
